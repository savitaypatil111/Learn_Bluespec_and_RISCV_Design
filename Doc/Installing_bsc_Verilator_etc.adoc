== Introduction

The next two sections briefly describe how to set up the Bluespec
_bsc_ compiler and the *Verilator* compiler which are needed to build
and run *Bluesim* and *Verilator* simulations, respectively, for Drum
and Fife.  We assume the Ubuntu Linux operating system but the setup
is quite similar on any other flavor of Linux, and on MacOS.

You can install it on your own Ubuntu system; or, you could use an
Ubuntu instance on Amazon AWS; the last section of this document shows
how.

// ****************************************************************

== Installing the _bsc_ compiler

NOTE: Any recent version of _bsc_ should suffice.  We have been using version 2025.01.

* Go to https://github.com/B-Lang-org/bsc[] ; you will be on the README page.
* Go to the "Download" section, click on the "Releases" link.
* On the "Releases" page, in the "Assets" section, find the release for your
  version of Ubuntu, such as `bsc-2024.01-ubuntu-22.04.tar.gz` for Ubuntu 22.04.
* Download it to your Ubuntu computer, and untar it, say in a directory `BSC`.
* Define the following environment variables (the latter places _bsc_
  in your shell's search path for executables):

----
    export BLUESPEC_HOME=BSC/bsc-2024.01-ubuntu-22.04
    export PATH=BSC/bsc-2024.01-ubuntu-22.04/bin:$PATH
----

* Check that it's been installed: the first command will run _bsc_ and
  have it print out its version; the second command will print its
  help message:

----
    $ bsc -v
    $ bsc --help
----

In your installation you will find the following documents (PDFs):

* *BSV* Language Reference Guide
* *BSV* Libraries Reference Guide
* *BSC* User Guide    (user guide for the _bsc_ compiler)

These PDFs can also be downloaded directy from the _bsc_ site.

// ****************************************************************

== Installing *Verilator*

NOTE: Any recent version of Verilator should suffice.  We have been using Verilator 5.038

Go to https://www.veripool.org/verilator[].  In the "Installation &
Documentation" section, follow the "Verilator installation and package
directory structure" link, which will take you to
https://verilator.org/guide/latest/install.html[].

The easiest way to install *Verilator* is described in the first
section on that page, "Package Manager Quick Install", namely to use
Ubuntu's standard `apt-get install` or `apt install` mechanism.  This
usually installs a somewhat older version of *Verilator* than the
latest, but that is usually fine.

The main *Verilator* page (link given above) also has a link to
download the *Verilator* user manual:
link:https://verilator.org/verilator_doc.pdf[(PDF)]

=== If you want to install a later version of *Verilator* ...

Follow the "Detailed Build Instructions" for building verilator from
sources.

* In the "Install Prerequisites" section, perform all the `sudo
  apt-get install` steps listed, except the last section which is only
  needed for *Verilator* developers.

* Skip the "Install SystemC" and "Install GtkWave" sections.

* Clone the repository, set it to the stable commit:

----
    $ git clone https://github.com/verilator/verilator
    $ cd verilator
    $ git checkout stable     
    $ autoconf
----

* Follow the "1. Run-in-Place from VERILATOR_ROOT" installation flow:

----
    $ export VERILATOR_ROOT=`pwd`   # if your shell is bash
    $ setenv VERILATOR_ROOT `pwd`   # if your shell is csh
    $ ./configure
    $ make
    $ make test
----

The *Verilator* executable is in `bin/verilator`: make sure it is in your `PATH`

// ****************************************************************

== Creating an Ubuntu instance on Amazon AWS

* Create an AWS account.  Details at: https://aws.amazon.com[]
* After sign-in, click on "EC2"
  If you don't see "EC2", click on "View all services", then click on "Compute EC2"
* Click on "Instances" (in "EC2 Dashboard" on left). This will show
  instances you have created so far, and their "state" (Running,
  Stopped, ...)
* Click on "Launch Instances" (orange button at top right)

* Fill in:
** Name and tags: ... choose a name for your instance
** Amazon Machine Image: ... select a recent, stable "Ubuntu", such as Version 22.04 LTS.
** Instance type: ... we recommend selecting "m6i.2xlarge" (8 vCPU, 32 GiB Mem)

** Key pair (login): If you already have a public/private key pair on
   AWS, it will offer that as a choice in a drop-down menu.  If not,
   then click on the button to create a new key pair.  When created,
   you will have to save your private key on your local machine in a
   file such as `~/.ssh/My_AWS_Key.pem`.

** Network Settings: ... leave everything as is.
** Configure Storage: ... offers 30 GiB; raise it if you wish
** Advanced Details: ... we recommend, for "Termination protection",
   select "Enable", so that you can't accidentallly delete your instance.
** Finally, click "Launch Instance"

* Go back to EC2 Dashboard; the new instance will be shown, up and running
** Various controls allow you to stop/start your instance. Remember to
   stop your instance when you are not using it, to avoid unnecessary
   billing!

* To connect to your new instance from a terminal on your computer:
** On the EC2 dashboard, select the new instance. In the displayed
   below, there will be an entry for "Public IPv4 DNS", such as:
   `ec2-54-175-18-155.compute-1.amazonaws.com`.  Copy the DNS address.
** From a terminal on your computer, connect to your instance:
----
    $ ssh -i ~/.ssh/My_AWS_key.pem  ubuntu@ec2-54-175-18-155.compute-1.amazonaws.com
----

* In Ubuntu, see the previous two sections of this document for
  installation of _bsc_ and *Verilator*.
